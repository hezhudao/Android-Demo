00:00:2,000 --> 00:00:6,300
Well, Stephen announce on Friday, We we certainly have a changed strategy.

2
00:00:6,500 --> 00:00:14,300
We are going to focus our energy on Microsoft windows phone
 as the central smart phone strategy, 

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,300
¡­That¡¯s said we do plan to ship a device of meego program sometime this year, 

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,300
¡­and I think it is critical important to deliver that and get the feedback for that, 

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,300
I have seen the device running 
 and it is beautiful and elegant, 

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,300
¡­and the hardware is interesting and the software is powerful 

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,300
¡­and it has Qt and QML on it and  all the technologies that people were heard about. 

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,300
We also announce that the third part of our strategy that we  were going to engage in  the work on a new disruptive platform. 

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,300
We don¡¯t want ever had happened to us, what is happen just recently which is get caught from behind. 

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,800
¡­and the smart phone had to turn , you know, to another place to build devices.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:2,300
So as we evaluate the feedback from meego, we¡¯re going to consider that feedback and the technologies were in,

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:8,300
for inclusion our, you know, next generation technologies or platform technologies that we talk about.
