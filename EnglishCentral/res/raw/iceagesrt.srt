1
00:00:1,400 --> 00:00:3,200
No one wants to die

2
00:00:3,400 --> 00:00:7,100
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there

3
00:00:7,500 --> 00:00:11,300
And yet death is the destination we all share

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,300
No one has ever escaped it

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,000
And that is as it should be

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,600
because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,400
It is Life's change agent 

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,000
It clears out the old to make way for the new

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,100
Right now the new is you

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,500
but someday not too long from now

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,300
you will gradually become the old and be cleared away

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,300
Sorry to be so dramatic

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,000
but it is quite true

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,200
Your time is limited

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,000
so don't waste it living someone else's life

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,200
Don't be trapped by dogma

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,300
which is living with the results of other people's thinking

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,100
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,100
And most important

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,100
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,100
They somehow already know what you truly want to become

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,400
Everything else is secondary
